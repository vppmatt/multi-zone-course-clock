# Multi-zone course clock

This project is a clock that displays the time in multiple time zones. It is ideal for use with online meetings or training courses where there are participants in different time zones. As well as displaying the current time in each time zone, you can put in future events (like coffee breaks) and see what time they are in each time zone too.
